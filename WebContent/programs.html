                <p id="students">After-school programs take place at the end of the school day for up to six additional hours of core subject tutoring every week. Classes meet three times a week, beginning in October and concluding in May. Lessons are taught in small groups of no more than 12 students, compared to the 35-40 found in the typical Israel school. Within this environment, teachers split students into groups of 3-4 students for more personalized learning.</p>

                <p id="teachers">This program offers an initial 2-day workshop designed to introduce teachers to the program and outline goals and methods. Afterwards, there are individual training sessions throughout the year on lesson planning, classroom management, time management, and technique for forming relationships with students. </p>

                <h2>Jewish quotes:</h2>
                <p><i>"The world endures for the breath of school-children."</i> <b>(Talmud Bavli Tractate Shabbat 119b)</b></p>
                <p>This quote explains how important education is, and how our world revolves around it.</p>
                <br/>
                <p><i>"He who teaches a child is as if he had created it."</i> <b>(Talmud Sanhedrin 19a)</b></p>
                <p>This quote teaches us how a person is not completely whole until they have been taught.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Both these quotes back up the importance of &#1495;&#1497;&#1504;&#64309;&#1498;, or the Jewish value of education.</p>
